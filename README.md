I spent over 60 hours total programming this assignment, and I still have a few things that I couldn't finish working on. I wasn't able to finish the option to choose random, as well as the option to put the output into a file, or pressing enter to exit the program.
When I looked into the system.("pause") function, all of the forums stated that it was not useable on a Mac computer, so I was unable to implement the program using this function. I was not able to finish the commenting and input validation as much as I wanted, but the rest of the program should work. I also included the Sample file I was testing with throughout the coding.
